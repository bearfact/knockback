Knockback
=========

Knockback provides the  missing link between the Backbone.js and
Knockout JavaScript libraries.

Purpose
-------

Backbone simplifies the process of creating rich browser-based apps and
works seamlessly with REST APIs, but it has no support for rendering your
views. Knockout has incredible data-binding and rendering capabilities for
keeping your views in sync with complex data structures, but you are
left responsible for the structure and implementation of the rest of
your app.

If only you could use Backbone and Knockout together, developing
client-side applications would be a breeze.... 

This is exactly what Knockback provides for you.
Now you can work with your Backbone models as you normally would, and
Knockback handles informing Knockout of the changes so your views are
automatically (re)rendered. Never again will you have to write a tedious
and error-prone render method in your Backbone view.
